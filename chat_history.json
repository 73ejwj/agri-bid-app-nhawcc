[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "\r\n\u200bApp Name: AgriBid\r\n\u200bShort Description: A direct-to-market platform that uses AI to connect farmers directly with companies and exporters for fair, transparent, and efficient trade of coffee, teff, and other agricultural products. Eliminates brokers and middlemen.  \r\n\u200bFull Description:\r\n\u200bAgriBid is an AI-powered marketplace app designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain. It will serve three primary user roles: Farmers, Companies (local buyers), and Exporters. The app\u2019s goal is to create a seamless, direct-from-farm-to-buyer ecosystem, ensuring fair pricing for farmers and transparent, quality-assured sourcing for buyers.  \r\n\u200bKey User Roles & Goals:\r\n\u200bFarmer: A farmer can register and create a profile. Their main goal is to list their produce, get a fair price, and find a buyer without a broker.\r\n\u200bCompany/Exporter: A company or exporter can search for specific products, assess quality, and purchase products directly from a farmer. Their goal is to find high-quality products efficiently and at a good price.\r\n\u200bCore Features and User Flows:\r\n\u200bUser Registration and Profile Creation:\r\n\u200bAllow users to sign up with their mobile number or email.  \r\n\u200bCreate three separate account types: Farmer, Company, and Exporter.\r\n\u200bA farmer's profile should include location, farm size, and a list of their products.\r\n\u200bA company/exporter's profile should include their business details and what products they are looking for.\r\n\u200bAI-Powered Product Listing (Main Feature):\r\n\u200bA farmer can create a new product listing for a crop (e.g., coffee, teff).\r\n\u200bThe farmer uploads a photo of their produce.\r\n\u200bAI Function: An integrated AI model analyzes the image to automatically assess and provide a quality grade for the crop. This assessment should be displayed on the product listing.\r\n\u200bThe farmer enters the quantity, price per unit, and location.\r\n\u200bMarketplace and Search:\r\n\u200bA company or exporter can view all available product listings on a main feed.\r\n\u200bImplement a search and filter system based on crop type (e.g., \"coffee,\" \"teff\"), quality grade, location, and price.\r\n\u200bIn-App Communication:\r\n\u200bA secure chat feature that allows farmers and buyers to communicate directly and negotiate details.\r\n\u200bThe chat should be linked to specific product listings.\r\n\u200bTransaction and Order Management:\r\n\u200bA buyer can place an order for a specific quantity of a product from a farmer.\r\n\u200bThe farmer receives a notification and can accept or decline the offer.\r\n\u200bOnce an order is accepted, both parties should see an \"Order Status\" page to track the transaction. This should include an option for secure payment integration (e.g., with a local mobile money provider or a bank).\r\n\u200bLogistics and Tracking (Future Feature):\r\n\u200bAI Function: An AI algorithm can suggest optimal shipping and logistics partners to the buyer, based on the location of the farm and the delivery address. This feature can be implemented in a later version.\r\n\u200bRequired Integrations (for AI and Functionality):\r\n\u200bFirebase/Google Cloud: For user authentication, database management, and cloud functions.  \r\n\u200bAI Model Hosting: A cloud-based service to host the image-recognition model for quality assessment.\r\n\u200bMobile Money/Payment Gateway API: To facilitate payments within the app."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand you want to build AgriBid, an AI-powered marketplace app connecting farmers directly with companies and exporters.
